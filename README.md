# CheatSheets
A repository to store all of my cheat sheets for various things. Why? Because
sometimes, you just need a little helping hand :blush:.

So, far, they consist of:

* [Big Data](https/://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/BigData.md)
* [C&#35;](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/CSharp.md)
* [Git](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/Git.md)
* [Laravel](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/Laravel.md)
* [MySQL](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/MySQL.md)
* [PHP](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/PHP.md)
* [PHPUnit](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/PHPUnit.md)
* [R](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/R.md)
* [Razor](https://github.com/s-moon/CheatSheets/blob/master/Razor.md)
